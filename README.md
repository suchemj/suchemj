# About Me 
I am a graduate research assistant at Virginia Commonwealth Univeristy specializing in microwave engineering. I enjoy working with almost anything that has to do with electromagnetics, especially reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and frequency selective surfaces. 

# ðŸ“¡ I'm currently working on
- Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces using transparent conductive oxides
- Wearable RFIDs for health applications
